# Fire Emblem Heroes
Random Fire Emblem Heroes generator

-Stats are based off the original formula; the Gen 2 stats may be implemented later.\
-When the hero is printed out, the leftmost stats are the base level 40 stats, while the rightmost ones are the stats after skills and weapons are added.\
-Stats are allocated by 1 point at a time being added to a random stat, which tends to lead to well-rounded units that don’t excel in much. I’m trying to figure out a better way to do it. Growths are calculated the same way.\
-The plus signs from weapon names aren’t there because I got lazy and didn’t feel like typing them but the Mt correlates to the + versions.\
-Only the most advanced forms of weapons are included (for example, Silver Bow+ and Slaying Edge+, but not Silver Bow and Killing Edge+). Exclusive weapons are exempt from this since the effects between evolved weapons can be different from the regular ones (such as with Excalibur and Dark Excalibur), although currently exclusive weapons aren't able to be used anyways. Assassin's Bow is included for the same reason.\
-Similarly, only the best forms of skills are included. For example, HP +5 is included, but not HP +3 or +4. This applied to powercrept skills as well. For example, Fortress Defense/Resistance 3 is included but neither Fortress Defense 3 or Fortress Resistance 3 are.
-The modifications for trainee and veteran heroes are in the code but it isn’t yet possible for a hero to be them.\
-Although they can technically have the skill, Armored units can't get Pass in this since it's useless on them. Similarly, only units with Sing or Dance can get the Dance B skills (although neither assists have been implemented yet)\
-Weapon refinements aren't included yet.

-I may have missed out on a couple weapons and skills, since I forgot to add Chilling Seal until recently when I was adding the Fallen Heroes skills (although exclusive skills are never selected so that didn't matter too much), but almost all of them should be there.
